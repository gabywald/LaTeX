<h1>Tips for maintainable Java code</h1>
<i></i><p><i>There are two ways of constructing a software design. One 
way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. 
And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
 deficiencies.</i> -- C.A.R. Hoare</p>
<p>Here's a random collection of personal observations (some well 
established to the point of cliché, some deliberately controversial and 
tongue in cheek) on things to watch out for while designing and 
implementing large scale object oriented applications. While much is 
applicable to other languages such as C++, these days I'm only 
interested in Java, so that's what the examples refer to. </p>

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
<li>Programmers need to be precise. If you're sloppy and inconsistent 
with spaces, indentation, names, or access modifiers, what confidence 
will people have that your logic is any more accurate? </li>
<li>A good framework can sometimes help developers by avoiding you 
having to reinvent the wheel each time, but a bad framework is 
infinitely worse than no framework at all. Designing good frameworks is 
very, very hard. Consider this point carefully and draw your own 
conclusions... </li>
<li>Test your code, and keep testing it. Automated unit tests can be 
very useful, particularly for modules that can be driven 
programmatically or from a command line. Trying to automate GUI tests, 
on the other hand, is a noble goal but usually doomed to failure. It 
takes a vast amount of effort with very little payback. The tests 
produced are very 'brittle' (they permanently fail, but nearly always 
because of new development or changes in the test data, rather than bugs
 in the code actually under test). </li>
<li>Keep your code simple and comprehensible. Source code that nobody 
understands is about as useful as a bug-ridden third party library with 
no documentation, no source code, and no support, i.e. not very! </li>
<li>Think about your reward structures. If the system rewards analysts 
for the length of their documents, programmers for the number of lines 
of code they write, consultants for the number of days they can invoice,
 and managers for the size of the teams they hire, then collectively 
this will do little to reduce the size or cost of your development! </li>
<li>Don't optimise too soon. Unless you're doing I/O or performing the 
same operation a million times or more, forget about optimising it until
 you've run the program under a profiler. (On the other hand, if you 
develop an exponential-time algorithm with test cases of half a dozen 
elements, don't be too surprised if performance is less than 
satisfactory on a real world data set of 10,000 rows!) </li>
<li>Using common design patterns can be useful, but only when 
appropriate: "It must be good design, look, I'm using the Visitor 
pattern!" "Why, exactly?" "Err, well, I've just got to page 79 in the 
book and haven't tried that one yet..." </li>
<li>Never test for an error condition you don't know how to handle! If 
you don't know how to handle exceptions properly then let them propagate
 up to someone who does, as undeclared runtime exceptions if necessary. 
(Don't make the mistake of catching an exception that contains precise 
details of an error, simply because it's declared and you "have to" 
catch it, and then silently return, neither reporting an error nor 
completing the operation the method was called to perform!) </li>
<li>Here's one for managers: learn to identify those developers with <i>negative</i>
 productivity (and, boy, do they exist!) and don't be afraid to sack 
them, or at least move them to a role such as testing or documentation 
where they won't cause as much damage. (That isn't meant to imply that 
testing isn't a valuable role - which it is - so much as the worst most 
people are likely to achieve at it is zero productivity.) </li></ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Document your design <i>after</i> you code it (or while you code it), not <i>before</i>.
 That way your documents stand at least some chance of corresponding 
with reality and still being useful when someone has to come along later
 and maintain your code. (Ok, <i>some</i> up front design is clearly a 
good idea, but you should still leave a large chunk of your 
documentation effort until after you've started coding). </li>
<li>It should go without saying that you <i>must</i> comment your code, and keep those comments up to date! Code that isn't worth commenting probably isn't worth executing either. </li>
<li>Any maintenance programmer who has had to work on code hacked about 
over the years by a myriad of other people will tell you that the <i>only</i> documentation they trust (or in all likelihood even <i>look</i>
 at) is the code itself. If a crucial piece of information is documented
 elsewhere, or if two or more files need to be maintained in sync, then 
say so in the code (in both places...). </li>
<li>Remember that it's much more important to document <i>why</i> a method exists than what it does. </li>
<li>If you find you need to use a debugger to understand the programming
 logic in your own code, something, somewhere, has gone badly wrong! </li>
<li>It sounds like a paradox but too much documentation is actually <i>worse</i>
 than too little documentation. Nobody will read it, it will be 
permanently out of date, and it lulls you into a false sense of 
security. </li>
<li>Avoid vacuous statements, e.g. commenting a method setList(List 
list) to say "This methods sets the list.". They're insulting and a 
waste of everybody's time. I might have guessed that it sets a list, but
 what list? Why? When? What does the object do with the list? Can it be 
null? etc. </li>
<li>Make sure you use a version control system that maintains an edit 
history, and try to enter a meaningful description of each change. 
(Again, it's more important to record <i>why</i> you made a change than what the change is.) </li></ul>

<h2>Java language</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you implement equals() or hashCode() <i>always</i> override 
both or neither (you're liable to encounter some very nasty and subtle 
bugs otherwise, once your objects start finding their way into 
hashtables, which they often do). </li>
<li>Consider overriding toString() to produce a useful description of 
the object (eg. the type of the object and the value of any unique id it
 contains). To avoid confusion, toString() on two objects should 
normally be equal if and only if equals() is true. </li>
<li>The result of calling equals() on an object of the wrong type is 
'false', not a ClassCastException. (Knowing that the "instanceof" 
operator doesn't throw a NullPointerException on a null argument but 
returns 'false' often helps, by the way.) </li>
<li>If your class is cloneable always call super.clone() rather than 
using "new" to create the new object. This is implemented natively and 
will create an object of the correct type even if your class is later 
extended. </li>
<li>Keys and other basic types should be <i>immutable</i>, ie. have no 
setters, only take on values at time of construction, implement equals()
 and hashCode(). For good measure, they could also have a string 
constructor that works if you pass in the value returned by toString(). </li>
<li>Immutable objects are the "first class citizens" of the object 
world. Semantically they behave exactly the same way as basic types. You
 can share instances without having to worry about anyone else modifying
 the value (or having the overhead of creating copies). Declare them to 
be final too and you have a self-contained, bullet-proof class, which 
should be every developer's highest aspiration. </li>
<li>Avoid duplicate representations of the same data that need to be 
maintained in sync. Instead, have a single master copy and use an 
adapter. </li>
<li>Think symmetrically. Every object that's created, every link that's 
made, every listener that's added, all need to be removed again, unless 
you consciously intend them to last the entire life of the VM or can be <i>certain</i>
 they will be garbage collected. Consider adding a dispose() method to 
your objects to forcibly break any references they hold and make the 
garbage collector's job easier. </li>
<li>Don't overuse threads. Unless you're sure you know what you're doing
 and sure you need some extra threads then you probably don't. </li>
<li>Java is not C++. It's generally good practice <i>not</i> to check 
for error conditions all over the place unless you expect the condition 
to occur and plan to do something specific with that knowledge. Let the 
VM take care of array bounds and null pointer checking while you 
concentrate on your design (programming logic that is correct and code 
that's clean and understandable). </li>
<li>This is an important point so to reiterate: <i>too much</i> error 
checking is a bad thing, especially if it's applied haphazardly. If I 
come across an existing class and see that in some methods a particular 
member variable is compared against null before it's used and in others 
it's dereferenced without a check, what am I to assume regarding the 
status of that variable?</li></ul>

<h2>Modularity</h2>

<ul>
<li>A good modular, componentized design means minimizing the knowledge 
and dependency one part of the system has to have about another. </li>
<li>Dogma has no place in practical programming, especially when it's 
driven by the latest trends in fashion, as often seems to be the case. 
Who remembers the introduction of macro assemblers, high level 
languages, procedural languages, structured programming, object oriented
 programming, 4GLs, CASE tools, UML, client-server, COM, JavaBeans, 
components, CORBA, frameworks, XML, J2EE, etc.? Each in their way 
promised to be the panacea of programming, delivering standard reusable 
components, and reducing the time to deliver applications to almost 
nothing. But looking back, who can truthfully claim that it's <i>cheaper</i> to develop software now than it was 10 or 15 years ago?! </li>
<li>The common theme of most of these methodologies is <i>modularity</i>.
 To make sense of a large complex system it is necessary to break it 
down into smaller parts somehow, with the minimum of interdependencies 
between those parts. The difficulty of course is knowing <i>which</i> 
parts. A good methodology may help you come up with a good design (in 
other words: a good breakdown into independent components), but by no 
means guarantees it. Nor does a good design necessarily depend on using 
any particular methodology.</li>
<li>If you view each component (method, class, file, package, 
application, or whatever) as a box, the important thing is having a 
clear mental picture that tells you which box a particular piece of 
functionality ought to go in (and even more importantly, which boxes it 
shouldn't). <i>Achieving that clear mental picture requires both skill and experience; there aren't any shortcuts! </i></li><i>
</i><li>If you encounter an ugly or difficult to use API, wrap it up in 
your own abstraction layer so that all the ugly code is in one place. 
You can then convert it easily to use a different back end while keeping
 the interface the same. Even if the API is clean and well established, 
for example JDBC, there may still be valid reasons to abstract from it. 
Does this mean you're likely to write your own database drivers? No. 
However, you <i>might</i> want to log all database accesses, or perhaps 
start persisting your objects via XML and HTTP rather than to a 
relational database, and it's obviously easier to do this if all the 
related code is in one place. </li>
<li>Avoid designs with complex interdependencies, such as having to 
write three new classes and change six others each time you add a new 
field to an existing table.</li>
<li>Having all your code in one big file may not be the epitome of good 
OO design but it makes it a darn sight easier to find something if you 
don't know where to look for it, and easier to modify too if the 
alternative is a morass of interdependent files. Perhaps that's extreme,
 but never underestimate the power of grep as a software development 
tool - the best identifiers are the ones you can easily search for! </li>
<li>Make sure you fully understand the concept of a <i>dependency</i>. 
Decide which packages are allowed to refer to which other ones and which
 aren't and strictly adhere to those rules (for example, you might have 
GUI code that can refer to and invoke methods on your business objects, 
but not vice versa). </li>
<li>Complexity in the implementation is fine, but <i>keep the API simple!</i></li></ul><i>

</i><h2>Just in time development and over-complexity</h2>

<ul>
<li>All code has a cost. Justify every class you write. Developers 
should be rewarded for functionality rather than code; if anything they 
should be <i>penalised</i> rather than rewarded for every new class or line of code they require to deliver that functionality. </li>
<li>Programmers love to be creative and demonstrate how clever they are 
at coming up with elegant and generalised designs. Don't let them - the 
objective is to write maintainable code, not an elaborate monument to 
one's own ego. </li>
<li>Virtually everybody loves to generalise, yet virtually nobody is any
 good at it. Until you've done something the hard way more than once 
it's very difficult to spot the general pattern. </li>
<li>Although the exact opposite has traditionally been ingrained in us, often it's actually better if we <i>do not</i>
 worry about the big picture or future requirements until we have to. 
When the future arrives you're going to have to change it anyway, and 
it's a <i>lot</i> easier to change a simple design, that admits it 
didn't try to anticipate all possible future requirements, than a 
complex one that tried but got it wrong, as they invariably do. </li>
<li>Take your pick as to which methodology name you pick to make the 
process sound respectable: "Just in time" development, iterative 
development cycles, RAD, timeboxed development, re-factoring, etc. The 
message is the same. Design and build <i>only</i> what you and your users understand <i>now,</i> and be prepared to review and change it once you have more complete knowledge. Throwing away and rewriting code is a <i>good</i> thing. Get it right <i>next</i> time. </li>
<li>Be very suspicious of generalised designs that are supposed to make 
things easier in future, unless you have a pretty good understanding of 
those requirements and what the payback will be <i>now</i>. </li>
<li>If you're determined to ignore this advice (as I'm sure you will), at least make <i>some</i>
 effort to quantify what long-term benefits you think your design will 
bring. All too often a developer will spend a week developing, then two 
weeks debugging a general solution where the specific solution will take
 a day to develop, a day to debug, and then a further 10 minutes two 
months later to adapt it to a new scenario. The developer will quite 
happily justify his two weeks of debugging effort, to himself and his 
manager, because it avoids the need for that one 10 minute change - and 
don't think I made those numbers up! </li>
<li>If a design is too complex and difficult to code correctly, the 
correct solution is a simpler design, not automatic code generators. If 
code is worth writing more than once, it's worth writing by hand each 
time! </li>
<li>Don't expose more methods in a class than you need (eg. gratuitous 
'convenience' methods). Once published, they form part of the contract 
of your class, and make it much more difficult to change in future. </li>
<li>Building software is the <i>opposite</i> of building bridges. Ten 
developers deliver twice as much code, four times as many bugs, and half
 as much functionality as five developers. I didn't make those numbers 
up either. (Of course, if managers are rewarded for the number of people
 they hire and size of budget they control then it's only natural that 
they'll build up as big a team is possible, regardless of whether that's
 good for the project or not.) </li>
<li>If it were possible to know all the requirements of a program in 
advance why are we still writing software today - wouldn't it all 
already have been written 20 years or more ago? (Arguably of course, 
nearly all the software that anybody really needs <i>was</i> written 20 
years ago, and everything developed since is fluff in the name of 
buzzword compliance, either just 'eye candy' or driven by marketing 
imperatives. Progress has its own inevitable inertia, and you need to be
 seen to be using the latest technology, regardless of whether it 
actually adds much tangible benefit to users!) </li>
<li>Let's face it, you and I and everyone else are going to write crap 
code anyway, so it may as well be cheap and simple crap code that you 
understand and can afford to throw away rather than complicated and 
expensive crap code. (The fact that 90% of the code written by 90% of 
developers is crap is a corollary of Sturgeon's law that 90% of <i>everything</i> is crap.) </li>
<li>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying generalised designs or frameworks
 are wrong in principle, far from it. The important thing is a good 
design, though, framework or no, and a good design almost invariably 
means a simple design.</li></ul>

<h2>Objects and classes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Think about what an object <i>is</i>, not what the class <i>does</i>.
 With relatively few exceptions (eg. some factories, or if you 
specifically need to encapsulate an algorithm or process) classes whose 
name is a verb (eg. something-"Manager") are <i>not</i> good OO design! </li>
<li>An object or instance, as opposed to a class, is defined by its <i>state</i>.
 Think about what its state is, and what the lifecycle of that object 
is. Who creates it and when, who owns it, when or how does it get saved,
 when or how does it get refreshed, when is it destroyed? etc. </li>
<li>Remember, what we do is called <i>object</i>-oriented programming, not <i>class</i>-oriented
 programming! (One reason, incidentally, why I'm not a huge fan of Rose 
models. I'm more interested in how many of something there are and how 
they're used than what they extend.) </li>
<li>Think instances: if two related objects always exist in a one-to-one
 relationship with each other, it's quite likely they're actually the 
same thing and should be a single class. </li>
<li>Complex switch statements, especially if they occur more than once 
in a class, are usually a sign of poor OO design and call for use of 
inheritance. Conversely, sometimes it <i>is</i> ok just to parametrize a
 class and write a simple 'if' statement. As with everything, apply 
common sense and "value your intelligence above the standard". </li>
<li>Don't use random classes or interfaces you stumble upon for other 
than their intended purpose, just because they happen to resemble the 
structure of what you want. (An AWT Dimension measures pixels on a 
screen, so don't use it to store the size of a football pitch in feet. A
 Swing ListModel defines the specific requirements of a JList component,
 not a general purpose collection interface.) </li>
<li>If a utility method doesn't access any instance variables in a class then you should probably declare the method static. </li>
<li>Don't use inheritance when aggregation is called for (think about 
whether the relationship is an "is-a" or "has-a" relationship).</li></ul>

<h2>Style</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be consistent with indendation style. Personally, I loathe and 
detest K&amp;R style indentation. The only logic behind it seems to be 
to avoid unecessary white space, which may have been useful once but 
when is the last time <i>you</i> edited code on a line printer or dumb 
VT100 terminal? Far more useful, surely, to clearly show how blocks line
 up - and far easier to spot when a rogue brace is missing. On the other
 hand, this is just my <i>personal</i> preference, and it's always more 
important to be consistent. If you need to add code to someone else's 
class make sure you respect the indentation style that's already in 
force (or use a pretty print utility afterwards, such as <a href="http://www.squarebox.co.uk/download/jpp.pl">jpp</a>). </li>
<li>There are some pretty strong conventions in Java that class names 
start with UpperCase, that packages are all lower case, that method and 
variable names start with lower case, that identifiers other than 
constants are in mixedCase and that constants are ALL_CAPS. It's also 
pretty much mandatory not just that the name of a source file matches 
the class name it contains but also that the directory structure matches
 the package name. </li>
<li>Avoid Hungarian notation (prefixing identifiers with things like 'm'
 and 'lpsz'), it's ugly and unnecessary. Trying to cram all the type and
 scope information into the variable name is a hangover from the days of
 C, when everything was stored in global variables. It suggests you 
either don't understand or don't trust the language and compiler. 
(Programmers need to keep track of the meaning of identifiers, so if you
 had a naming scheme that told you who owns an object, or whether it's 
the master or a temporary copy of some information, then that might 
actually be useful, not one that tells you what's already known.) </li>
<li>Many people put the private instance variables of a class at the 
bottom of the file, reasoning that users of the class shouldn't be 
concerned with the implementation. That's true, but missing the point 
slightly. Having a picture of what <i>state</i> a class embodies is 
essential to understanding the class as a whole and therefore one of the
 first things you look at, irrespective of whether you plan to access 
that state directly. </li>
<li>Be consistent with your names. If variables in two different scopes 
have the same meaning, or if methods in two classes do the same thing, 
give them the same name. If you abbreviate a name, do so consistently.</li></ul>

<h2>Pulling it all together</h2>
<p>Or not: </p>

<ul>
<li>For a particularly bad example of how not to generalise a class, 
take a look at the abomination that is GregorianCalendar. Vastly 
overcomplicated and difficult to use, and full of concepts in the wrong 
place, inappropriate abstractions and inconsistent names. Why does a 
Calendar contain an instance in time rather than just embodying the 
rules for doing date arithmetic? Why does a Date have set methods (a 
more classic example of an object that ought to be immutable than a date
 or timestamp is difficult to imagine)? Why deprecate methods that 
create or display a Date as UTC/GMT (by definition a <i>universal</i> representation that <i>can</i>
 be depended on without any further locale information) and yet leave in
 a toString() method that defaults to Pacific Daylight Time?! Why expose
 a complicated API that reveals internal implementation details and yet 
hide a safe and useful method like getTimeInMillis(), another 
unambiguous and universal representation? The designers thought they 
were so clever and forward-looking in not assuming a year starts on 
January 1, yet still have constants like MONDAY or PM. Above all, why is
 it so big and slow? (The 1.1 date classes are wrong at so many levels 
you're left wondering if the whole thing was just a sick joke, which 
might even have been quite funny if they weren't part of the core 
language and we were now stuck with the thing!) </li></ul>

<p>By far the biggest cost in any project is fixing and maintaining the code, <i>not</i> developing it in the first place. So: </p>

<ul>
<li>Think about users of your class. </li>
<li>Design for understandability and maintainability. </li>
<li>Remember that <i>complexity</i> is the number one enemy of <i>maintainability</i>. </li>
<li>Less is more! </li></ul>
