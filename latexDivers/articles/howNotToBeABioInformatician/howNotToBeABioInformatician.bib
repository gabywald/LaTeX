	The Seven Deadly Sins Of Bioinformatics
	
	
	
	As I am concerned with applying for a bioinformatics MSc., so I am
	looking for informations of that field, mainly those ones providing
	a critique panorama of its current (and, of course, future) trends
	and games. What I have most heard is that bioinformatics is the future,
	the 21st Century Job, it will help to replace the petrochemical industry
	bringing to us an alternative energy resource which is not only green,
	but, also, renewable, and so on. Despite all those positive remarks,
	I am not interested in them. I want to know critique statements about
	that field, what is hard to find out when talking to bioinformaticians
	here, since what they have told makes me feel as though I was in
	a Marlboro ad. :)
	
	
	I have found a very interesting presentation about the deadly sins
	of bioinformatics, see this link:
	
	
	The Seven Deadly Sins Of Bioinformatics.
	
	
	The Seven Deadly Sins Of Bioinformatics are the following:
	
	
	01. Parochialism And Insularity
	
	02. Exceptionalism
	
	03. Autonomy Or Death!
	
	04. Vanity: Pride And Narcissism
	
	05. Monolith Megalomania
	
	06. Scientific Method Sloth
	
	07. Instant Gratification
	
	
	Gosh! A bioinformatics laboratory being the lair of at least one of
	those sins could become a hard place to social interaction.
	
	
	By the way, the presentation is a nice overview of what is happening
	nowadays in bioinformatics, its current research situation and the
	views the computer science guys have of the biology guys (and vice-versa).

	A series of observations on Genetic Analysis algorithms and experiments
	
	Law's First Law
	
	
	"The first step in developing a new genetic analysis algorithm is
	to decide how to make the input data file format different from all
	pre-existing analysis data file formats."
	
	 A prime exemplar of this Law is the use of different codes to signify
	the sex of animals. For example, crimap uses '0' to represent female
	and '1' to represent male. The algorithm designed by Keightly et
	al. uses the same codes to mean the opposite sexes.The Knott & Haley
	QTL analysis algorithm uses codes '1' and '2'. The list goes on.
	
	
	Law's Second Law
	
	
	"Error messages should never be provided"
	
	
	corollary...
	
	"If error messages are provided, they should be utterly cryptic so
	as to convey as little information as possible to the end user"
	
	 Do you understand crimap's error messages? I thought not.
	
	
	Law's Third Law
	
	
	"The number of unique identifiers assigned to an individual is never

  abstract = {I spent a lot of last year urging people to work on stuff that matters.
	This led to many questions about what that “stuff” might be. I’ve
	been a bit reluctant to answer those questions, because the list
	is different for everyone. I thought I’d do better to start the new
	year with some ideas about how to think about this for yourself.
	
	
	First off, though, I want to make clear that “work on stuff that matters”
	does not mean focusing on non-profit work, “causes, or any other
	form of “do-goodism.” Non-profit projects often do matter a great
	deal, and people with tech skills can make important contributions,
	but it’s essential to get beyond that narrow box. I’m a strong believer
	in the social value of business done right. We need to build an economy
	in which the important things are paid for in self-sustaining ways
	rather than as charities to be funded out of the goodness of our
	hearts.
	
	
	There are a number of half-unconscious litmus tests I use in my own
	life. I’m going to try to tease them out here, and hope that you
	can help me think this through in the comments.
	
	
	 Work on something that matters to you more than money.
	
	
	 I addressed this topic in my commencement address at SIMS a few years
	ago, and I’ll think I’ll just quote myself here.
	
	
	 Some of you may end up working at highflying companies. Some of you
	may succeed, and some of you may fail. I want to remind you that
	financial success is not the only goal or the only measure of success.
	It’s easy to get caught up in the heady buzz of making money. You
	should regard money as fuel for what you really want to do, not as
	a goal in and of itself. Money is like gas in the car — you need
	to pay attention or you’ll end up on the side of the road — but a
	well-lived life is not a tour of gas stations!
	
	
	 Whatever you do, think about what you really value. If you’re an
	entrepreneur, the time you spend thinking about your values will
	help you build a better company. If you’re going to work for someone
	else, the time you spend understanding your values will help you
	find the right kind of company or institution to work for, and when
	you find it, to do a better job.
	
	
	 Don’t be afraid to think big. Business author Jim Collins says that
	great companies have “big hairy audacious goals.” Google’s motto,
	“access to all the world’s information” is an example of such a goal.
	I like to think that my own company’s mission, “changing the world
	by sharing the knowledge of innovators,” is also such a goal.
	
	
	 Don’t be afraid to fail. There’s a wonderful poem by Rainer Maria
	Rilke that talks about the biblical story of Jacob wrestling with
	an angel, being defeated, but coming away stronger from the fight.
	It ends with an exhortation that goes something like this: “What
	we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What
	we want is to be defeated, decisively, by successively greater things.”
	
	
	
	 One test of a bubble is how many entrepreneurs are focused on their
	upcoming payday rather than on the big things they hope to accomplish.
	Me-too products are almost always payday-focused; the entrepreneurs
	who first made the market often had much less expectation of easy
	success, and were instead wrestling, like Jacob with the angel, with
	a hard problem that they thought they could solve, or at the very
	least make a dent on.
	
	
	 It’s also clear that if you’re thinking more about the competition
	than you are about customers and the value you’re going to create
	for them, you’re on the wrong path. As Kathy Sierra once put it,
	“In many cases, the more you try to compete, the less competitive
	you actually are.”
	
	
	 The most successful companies treat success as a byproduct of achieving
	their real goal, which is always something bigger and more important
	than they are.
	
	 Create more value than you capture.
	
	
	 It’s pretty easy to see that Bernie Madoff wasn’t following this
	rule; nor were the titans of Wall Street who ended up giving out
	billions of dollars in bonuses to themselves while wrecking our economy.
	It’s harder to judge the average small business, but it’s pretty
	clear that most businesses do in fact create value for their community
	and their customers as well as themselves, and that the most successful
	businesses do so in part by creating a self-reinforcing value loop
	with their customers.
	
	
	 For example, a bank that loans money to a small business sees that
	business grow, perhaps borrow more money, hire employees who make
	deposits and take out loans, and so on. The power of this cycle to
	lift people out of poverty has been demonstrated by microfinance
	institutions like the Grameen Bank. Grameen is clearly focused on
	creating more value than they capture; not so the like of Fannie
	Mae and Freddy Mac, or WaMu, or many of the other failed financial
	institutions involved in the current financial meltdown. They may
	have started there, but at some point, they clearly became more concerned
	with how much value they could capture for themselves.
	
	
	 If you’re succeeding at this goal, you may sometimes find that others
	have made more of your ideas than you have yourself. It’s OK. I’ve
	had more than one billionaire (and an awful lot of startups who hope
	to follow in their footsteps) tell me how they got their start with
	a couple of O’Reilly books. I’ve had entrepreneurs tell me that they
	got the idea for their company from something I’ve said or written.
	That’s a good thing! I remember back in the early days of the Internet,
	when the buyer at Borders told me after one of my talks, “Well, you’ve
	just given your competitors their publishing program for the year.”
	If my goal is really “changing the world by spreading the knowledge
	of innovators,” I’m thrilled when my competitors jump on the bandwagon
	and help me spread the word!
	
	
	 Look around you: How many people do you employ in fulfilling jobs?
	How many customers use your products to make their own living? How
	many competitors have you enabled? How many people have you touched
	that gave you nothing back?
	
	
	 There’s a wonderful section in Les Miserables about the good that
	Jean Valjean does as a businessman (operating under the pseudonym
	of Father Madeleine). Through his industry and vision, he makes an
	entire region prosperous, so that “there was no pocket so obscure
	that it had not a little money in it; no
	
	 dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it.”
	And the key point:
	
	
	 Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing
	
	 in a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were
	his
	
	 chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little
	of
	
	 himself.
	
	
	Focusing on big goals rather than on making money, and on creating
	more value than you capture are closely related principles. The first
	one is a test that applies to those starting something new; the second
	is the harder test that you must pass in order to create something
	enduring.
	
	
	Take Microsoft. They started out with a big goal, “a computer on every
	desk and in every home,” and for many years unquestionably created
	more value than they captured. They helped grow the PC industry as
	a whole; they built a platform that helped many small software vendors
	to flourish. But over time, they began to capture more value than
	they created: as the cost of PCs plummeted, hardware vendors had
	to survive on the slimmest of margins while Microsoft collected monopoly
	rents; bit by bit, Microsoft consumed its own developer ecosystem
	by building the features of successful startups into their own products,
	and using their operating system dominance to crush the early movers.
	As I’ve written elsewhere, I believe that Microsoft must re-commit
	itself to big goals beyond its own profitability, and to creating
	more value than it captures if it is to succeed. (Danny Sullivan
	wrote a great piece about the strategic relevance of this very idea
	just last week, Tough Love for Microsoft Search.)
	
	
	Or take Google. Again, a huge goal: “Organize all the world’s information.”
	And like Microsoft in its early years, they are enabling others while
	making a pile of money for themselves. Any business with a web presence
	need only take a look at its referrer logs if it questions that assertion.
	How much of your traffic comes from Google? But again, as I’ve written
	previously, this test still looms in Google’s future. Will they continue
	to create more value than they capture, or will they seek to capture
	more of the value for themselves?
	
	
	It’s a matter of balance. Every business needs to pay attention to
	its bottom line; every individual needs to put a roof over his or
	her head and provide food for loved ones. But take a look inside:
	how much are you thinking about yourself and what you might gain,
	versus what you might create?
	
	
	It’s particularly tough to stay focused on big issues in the face
	of an economic downturn, because getting paid looms large. I look
	back at some of the decisions I made after the crash in 2001, when
	I became far more focused on the survival of my business than on
	the value we were going to create in the marketplace. We did some
	me-too publishing that I really regret; the things that ultimately
	made a bigger difference to our bottom line were commitments to the
	future: our Web 2.0 events were driven by the goal of reigniting
	enthusiasm in the computer industry as well as helping people to
	understand the new rules of the emerging internet platform; Safari
	Books Online was driven by the desire to create a new revenue model
	not just for ourselves but for all publishers; Make: was a celebration
	of the next generation of hackers; Foo Camp started as a way to give
	something back to all the people who’d contributed to our success.
	
	
	But these two tests are not enough, because it’s become clear that
	we need a long term ecological perspective as well. So I’d add a
	third principle:
	
	
	3. Take the long view.
	
	
	Brian Eno tells a great story about the experience that led him to
	conceive of the ideas that led to The Long Now Foundation:
	
	
	 It was 1978. I was new to New York. A rich acquaintance had invited
	me to a housewarming party, and, as my cabdriver wound his way down
	increasingly potholed and dingy streets, I began wondering whether
	he’d got the address right. Finally he stopped at the doorway of
	a gloomy, unwelcoming industrial building. Two winos were crumpled
	on the steps, oblivious. There was no other sign of life in the whole
	street.
	
	
	 “I think you may have made a mistake”, I ventured.
	
	
	 But he hadn’t. My friend’s voice called “Top Floor!” when I rang
	the bell, and I thought – knowing her sense of humour – “Oh – this
	is going to be some kind of joke!” I was all ready to laugh. The
	elevator creaked and clanked slowly upwards, and I stepped out –
	into a multi-million dollar palace. The contrast with the rest of
	the building and the street outside couldn’t have been starker.
	
	
	 I just didn’t understand. Why would anyone spend so much money building
	a place like that in a neighbourhood like this? Later I got into
	conversation with the hostess. “Do you like it here?” I asked. “It’s
	the best place I’ve ever lived”, she replied. “But I mean, you know,
	is it an interesting neighbourhood?” “Oh – the neighbourhood? Well…that’s
	outside!” she laughed. 
	
	
	In the talk many years ago where I first heard him tell this story,
	Brian went on to describe the friend’s apartment, the space she controlled,
	as “the small here,” and the space outside, full of winos and derelicts,
	as “the big here.” He went on from there, along with others, to come
	up with the analogous concept of the Long Now.
	
	
	It’s very easy to make local optimizations, but they eventually catch
	up with you. Our economy has many elements of a ponzi scheme. We
	borrow from other countries to finance our consumption, we borrow
	from our children by saddling them with debt and using up non-renewable
	resources.
	
	
	It’s hard to see beyond the “small here” and the “short now,” especially
	if you live in a favored place and time. That’s why so many of the
	really important things do end up on the plates of non-profits.
	
	
	That’s why a time like this, when the bubble is bursting, is a great
	time to see how important it is to think about the big picture, and
	what matters not just to us, but to building a sustainable economy
	in a sustainable world.
