D'ni Script Standard 2.2  - What's new?
---------------------------------------

01.10.2000
 -Corrected the blue color symbol in all three fonts - I forgot
  the dot in the center!
  Many thanks to ~Brad~ (HishinoSenshi@aol.com) for informing me.
 -on a side note: I got my hands on an old version of
  Macromedia Fontographer (version 4.1), and it crashes when
  loading any of the D'ni fonts. Apparently there are some faults
  in the encoding of the TTF files. On a few systems, Windows
  won't allow to install them because of that. Luckily, the fonts
  seem to work on most machines nevertheless.
  I'll see what I can do fix this problem.

 -Corrected the structure of the Moiety dagger and the number symbols
 -Internet Explorer didn't display the symbols that are mapped
  to the extended letters such as í, Ä, etc.
  Gave the fonts a code page character range, now it works.
 -Enlarged the space between the lines for better readability.


20.03.2000
 -Fixed an error in the "incorrect z" glyph of "D'NI_SCR.TTF"


18.03.2000
 -First release of version 2.2, including "D'ni Script LM" and "D'ni Script Angular".
 -All characters enhanced again.
 -The ones which are printed in "From Myst to Riven" are nearly 100% identical.
  They are: ['][v][t][s][j][y][x][a][f][i][e][r][m][þ][ð][u][n]
  (including their dotted derivatives, of course)
 -Characters which I had to model on low resolution images:
  [h][o][ç][w][c][l][æ][z][-][.], incorrect z, non-standard l
  Nevertheless, they are pretty accurate! ;-)
 -Number symbols are exactly constructed
 -Same thing for the colour symbols
